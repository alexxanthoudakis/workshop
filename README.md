A shared repository for a tutorial

1. Create an issue in this repository. Make it descriptive and unique enough to distinguish from your peers.

1. Create a fork of this repository in your own GitHub account.

1. Use GitHub Desktop to clone or download your forked repository to your computer.

1. Create a branch in your repository. You will use this branch to make changes to fix the issue you created in step one. I like to use `gh-##-name` for branch names. `gh-12-fix-naming-locations` for example, so I know that this is going to address GitHub issue #12 about naming locations.

1. Make the changes to your repository. Open the file named for your initials and add some content. You can use any text editor for this. I like to use Atom.

1. Use GitHub Desktop to commit your changes. If you include the phrase 'fixes sfu-dhil/workshop#12' in your commit message, that issue will be automatically closed later. If you don't do that you will need to close the issue manually.

1. Push your changes to GitHub.

1. Create a Pull Request. You can use GitHub Desktop or the GitHub website to do this. Tag or assign someone to the request if you'd like.

1. Merge your pull request. If your commit didn't include the magic code to close the issue you are working on, close it manually now.

1. Update your fork of the repository.
